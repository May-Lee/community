* GitLab migration meeting w/Six Feet Up
       Request discovery phase timeboxed of min. 50 hours
       They seem to really know Trac
       Suggested that data mapping might be needed
       We need to decide:
              We want to do the discovery phase?
              Full scope for discovery phase (links, metadata, PRs etc.)
              Should we "ticket garden"?
              What issue tracker will we use for GitLab?

_______________________________________________________________________

* Still waiting on FOSSHost; Discourse is being worked on

* Meeting w/Carol tomorrow w/Sajith & May-Lee

* Mailing list is kind of broken today, because the machine hosting
  tahoe-lafs.org does not do outbound email delivery well.  Jean-Paul
  and Sajith will address that problem.

* Who uses Tahoe-LAFS these days?
     Users of I2P - 1800 views on a setup post on I2p forum
     PyPi downloads
     We will get list of projects/other user details from Liz
     Likely too soon to do user surveys

* RFP scheduling - Meejah, Sajith, Jean-Paul will schedule among themselves
    Best around 2nd week of March
    Need to have one cryptographer on hand
        
* Test Grid servers will be set up at a future date for users

* A short description of Tahoe-LAFS:
    "We are a FOSS decentralized file store that has been around for
    over a decade. Tahoe-LAFS creates redundant copies of parts of a
    file, encrypts them and sends them to multiple servers. This design
    allows for data privacy and security from multiple attacks."

* GitLab migration probably will take place via contractor

* Community Roadmap and Resources Document
    Add detailed Development view with links to tickets etc. on sheet 3

* We will seek to release a Python 3 supporting txip

* Financial transparency: current disclosure on BTC explorer is good for now

February 16, 2021
_______________________________________________________________________
* BASICS hiring direction
    We decided to choose a Testing and Release person
    We will keep in touch with the other person and Jessica Rose for future
    roles

* What do we need from a Web Developer?
    We need to do the work and decide what we like
        Look at Dribbbl or Behance etc.
    Whatever they give us must be maintainable somehow
        Must use GitHub/GitLab, some kind of VCS
    Strong preference towards designer/front end
    Need a proper API
    Our main site could just be a GitLab Pages
    
* "We should have a self-hosted GitLab"
    Least Authority's GitLab migration took two days
    Should we forget about GitLab.com?

* Roadmap - tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/ticket/3604
    Tahoe will possibly be ultimately a federated model
        Python 3 Porting
        Getting rid of Foolscap
        Grid Manager
        Accounting system (User IDs and Leases)
        Web UI redesign

_______________________________________________________________________

* What should we do with the tahoe-dev mailing list?
    We will try out hosting a forum on Discourse to take over the main
    function of the old mailing list

* Should we use a paid CircleCI account? https://circleci.com/pricing/
    We will try upgrading to a "performance" account

* Thoughts about a community-run Jitsi instance?
    We will apply to fosshost.org and try their Jitsi

* Crafting a structure for the Small Grants program
    We want to utilize resources such as Le Wagon to build a funnel
    However, we should choose appropriate tickets/projects
    Namely, Web/UI focused projects can be spun out

* We now have $250 USD/mo in the form of a credit card via Aspiration
    We will now begin to get all accounts under one account
