_______________________________________________________________________
* Updates:
        No response from FOSSHost :( 
        tahoe-lafs.discourse.group approved
                need to work on astehtics/etc.
       
* Onboarding new Testing and Release Manager
        How to best utilize person w/in 6 mos/what is reasonable?
        What would onboarding look like?
        Who should their points of contact be?

* Meeting w/Six Feet Up (Sales) - TBD
        Quality of migration
                in progress PRs
                links between tickets should still work
                links between pages should still work
                authorship is important
                metadata in tickets
                what is unavoidable?
        Timeline/transition
        Pricing
        
* Summit 2021        
        It's time to start planning
        Agenda items?
        PyCon (mid-May/virtual) or other time?
        Virtual or IRL preferred (if possible ofc)
        
* What to do with the mailing list?

  - Before trying to adopt Discourse in earnest, should we give the
    mailing list another chance?

  - How about sending a "probe" to the mailing list to assess how many
    people are actually reading it?  Can we ask our current list
    subscribers about their preferences regarding mailing lists versus
    discord?

  - Would it be worthwhile to re-enliven the mailing list, even by a
    modest amount?  (By sending periodic status updates, meeting
    minutes, introductions, and the such.)

* Who uses Tahoe-LAFS these days?

  - We don't have much of an idea about who uses Tahoe-LAFS, and how,
    and what do they need.  Can we gather some data using surveys?

* What should we do with the tahoe-dev mailing list?
    We will try out hosting a forum on Discourse to take over the main
    function of the old mailing list
