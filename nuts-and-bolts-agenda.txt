_______________________________________________________________________

* What should we do with the tahoe-dev mailing list?

* Should we use a paid CircleCI account? https://circleci.com/pricing/
    If so, please recommend a product.

* Thoughts about a community-run Jitsi instance?
    Do we want this?

* Crafting a structure for the Small Grants program
    Notes on meeting with the Outcomes Manager at Le Wagon Coding Bootcamp
    Thoughts about the grants program?

* https://fosshost.org provides hosted video meetings (using
  BigBlueButton or Jitsi) for free software projects.  Could we apply
  for an account with them?

  They also offer web and email hosting and DNS, but not mailing lists
  as far as I can tell.  They can offer a VPS though, so perhaps we
  can run mailman there, although that is not ideal.  Each service
  requires a separate application.  They ask if we're able to donate,
  in case they're ever in a crunch.

  Docs for fosshost is at https://docs.fosshost.org.

* We now have $250 USD/mo in "petty cash"
    Aspiration can see all purchases/control the card
    Should purchases be made public? Monthly?
    Who else should get the CC info (should at least 1 other person?)
    The limit is set higher than our current needs for 2 purposes: 
        1. In case of annual billing for some products
        2. One-off/event expenses
