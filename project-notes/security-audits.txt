Pre-audit meetings postponed until sometime March - May
    Cryptographers will be solicited via IRC, Discourse and mailing list
    Prospective cryptographers will be required to read:
    https://tahoe-lafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/proposed/http-storage-node-protocol.html
    Commit to having 2, 1 hour conversations over 1 week (remote)
    Add their perspective as another set of eyes to the protocol, including:
    What do they think could be different about the protocol?
    What might have been missed, in terms of possible issues? Opportunites?
    Is there any horrendous flaw here before we get audited?
    And generally get the protocol as honed as possible before audit
