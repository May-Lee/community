Documentation improvements suggestions
    Less, and better written
    For now, start with topic guides
        Installation
        Consuming storage
        Providing storage
        How to run a friend net 
        Running hybrid local cloud grid, with a backup in the cloud
        Integrating Tahoe-LAFS as a storage layer in your app
    As documentation is written/tested, it can reveal ways in which Tahoe can be 
    improved, so it's a good opportunity to generate more tickets
