Ultimate goal is a self-hosted GitLab instance, but that would require 
some kind of support (managed offering is 800/mo including licenses and server
support)
Need to get issue tracker 
Consensus reached in March was Sajith was going to look more into it, with zFEC
as a test case
Jean-Paul has suggested using the GitLab export format from the Trac DB
(presumably an artifact) vs. the GitLab API
Otherwise, this project should be spun up into a Gig and sent to the community 
We need to come up with a budget for that 
At this stage, this type of thing should be offered to the Discourse, mailing 
list, and linked to the IRC 
Should parts of the Trac be archived? As they might actually no longer be
relevant (e.g., general speculative features older than 5 years)
GitLab to GitLab is about 30 hours

Dealing with:
In-progress PRs 
Links between tickets should still work 
Links between pages should still work 
Authorship is important 
Custom metadata to tickets
