Ultimate goal is a self-hosted GitLab instance, but that would require 
some kind of support 
Need to get issue tracker 
Consensus reached in March was Sajith was going to look more into it, with zFEC
as a test case
Jean-Paul has suggested using the GitLab export format from the Trac DB
(presumably an artifact) vs. the GitLab API
Otherwise, this project should be spun up into a Gig and sent to the community 
We need to come up with a budget for that 
At this stage, this type of thing should be offered to the Discourse, mailing 
list, and linked to the IRC
