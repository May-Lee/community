BIG QUESTION: Eligibility criteria/preferences for these roles?
Merged PR on or before the posting of the position?
Then contributor/other affiliate?
Then community/local/historical?

Gigs 
    Migrate from Trac to GitLab
    Set up UI for test grid
Grants 
    Implementations (needs spec first)
        Haskell (not sure how far this is)
        Rust 
        JavaScript 
        iOS 
        Android
Internships (possibly more like a research internship)
    IDEAS
    I want to start in July
    Internship cycle: 3 x year
    Current intern evaluates candidates and trains next intern
    So a sample schedule:
    Month 0 - application, evaluation and acceptance period
        Apply via a PR on a repo(?)
        Current intern and 2 core evaluate applicants
    Month 1 - onboarding
        Start public repo for the project
        3 X week 30-45 minute stand-up w/alternating core members + current
        intern
        Encourage use of IRC
        Have an intern alumni Slack channel (yep)
        Finalize project design (should be pretty final by the time selected)
    Month 2 -3 - golden month of introversion
        No meetings, just weekly checkins
        OFC can use Slack/IRC anytime
        Encourage interns to really get into their projects
    Month 4 - reearch + new application, evaluation and acceptance period
        So budget about 10-15 hours to read applications
        3 hours for selection
        Like these are not time-boxed intervals; the best way to handle it is to
        subtract about 1 week's worth of work from your project
        Because you'll be busy with this task
    Month 5 - research month and stand-ups
        During the new intern's onboarding, you will do 3 standups in one of the
        middle weeks
    Month 6 - presentation in last week of month
        First three weeks are protected; weekly meetings as usual but no other
        duties
        Last week prepare and give presentation
        1 hour presentation, followed by Q & A for about 30-45 minutes
