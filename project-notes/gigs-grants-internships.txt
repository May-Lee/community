Merged PR on or before the posting of the position?
Then contributor/other affiliate?

Code Steward Internship
    Inspired by Nadia Eghbal (Working in Public, Stripe, 2020)
        60% of code is about maintenance, not creation 
        Intrinsic motivation leads to the creation of code
        Extrinsic motivation (i.e., renumeration) usually required for maintenance
        Google rewrites its codebase every 3 or so years
            Helps reduce complexity
            Helps modernize or remove unnecessary code
            Helps new developers take more ownership in the code base 
    "Code Steward" is a new term to describe "Project Maintainer"
    Trained position with clearly defined duties 
    Learning opportunity OR a way for past contributor to get involved 

Research internship idea - too complicated; shelve till 2022
    IDEAS
    I want to start in July
    Internship cycle: 3 x year
    Current intern evaluates candidates and trains next intern
    So a sample schedule:
    Month 0 - application, evaluation and acceptance period
        Apply via a PR on a repo(?)
        Current intern and 2 core evaluate applicants
    Month 1 - onboarding
        Start public repo for the project
        3 X week 30-45 minute stand-up w/alternating core members + current
        intern
        Encourage use of IRC
        Have an intern alumni Slack channel (yep)
        Finalize project design (should be pretty final by the time selected)
    Month 2 -3 - golden month of introversion
        No meetings, just weekly checkins
        OFC can use Slack/IRC anytime
        Encourage interns to really get into their projects
    Month 4 - reearch + new application, evaluation and acceptance period
        So budget about 10-15 hours to read applications
        3 hours for selection
        Like these are not time-boxed intervals; the best way to handle it is to
        subtract about 1 week's worth of work from your project
        Because you'll be busy with this task
    Month 5 - research month and stand-ups
        During the new intern's onboarding, you will do 3 standups in one of the
        middle weeks
    Month 6 - presentation in last week of month
        First three weeks are protected; weekly meetings as usual but no other
        duties
        Last week prepare and give presentation
        1 hour presentation, followed by Q & A for about 30-45 minutes
