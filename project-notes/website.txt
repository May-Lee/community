Tahoe can be seen as a boring infrastructure project. 
Aside from a landing page, it would be good to install and configure a Tahoe
client and create a design around it.

Possible asethetics:

https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/
https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/

Sample prototype:
https://sajith.github.io/tahoe-website/

Mentioned "must haves":
Fast PR doc contributions visible on website
Dev guide
Demo grid
Mailing List sign-up
Maybe a roadmap?

Skills preferred:
WordPress is a NO. We would like to avoid a specific framework - so
someone who would be willing to build WITHOUT Jekyll, Rails, Flask, Django,
React, etc.
Hakyll and Pelican are okay.
Even if they're just really strong in CSS, HTML and JS that should be enough.

We would set them up with a repo on GitHub and they could work on the
website from there, deploying as necessary.
So they should be comfortable with or willing to learn Git/GitHub.

We prefer someone who is more focused on the front end/creating a nice design
Can create a components library on Figma (including color scheme/layout)
create .svg versions of Tahoe assets/create an assets folder
CSS framework can be Bootstrap or Bulma
Understanding of REST APIs
Vanilla JavaScript/avoid jQuery

The main task will be designing a website to act as a landing page for
the project

There may be another task where they design a user interface for file
upload/download
